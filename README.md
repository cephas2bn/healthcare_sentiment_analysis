# Healthcare Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze sentiment in healthcare-related data, providing insights into patient feedback, healthcare provider performance, and general public sentiment regarding healthcare topics. By applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques and sentiment analysis models, this project helps identify key areas for improvement and highlight positive trends in healthcare services.

## Features
- **Sentiment Detection**: Classifies text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenizes, lemmatizes, and removes stop words for cleaner input.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays trends, sentiment distribution, and significant keywords.
- **Model Training**: Customizable sentiment classification model with options for fine-tuning.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset
The dataset contains healthcare-related reviews, feedback, and public sentiment data. It includes columns for text data, associated sentiments, and additional metadata such as location, date, and healthcare provider ratings.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language for processing and model implementation.
- **NLTK & SpaCy**: For text preprocessing and tokenization.
- **scikit-learn**: Used for model training and evaluation.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: For deep learning model training.
- **Plotly & Matplotlib**: For visualizing sentiment trends and analysis.

## Installation
To run this project locally:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-sentiment-analysis.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up environment variables if necessary (e.g., for API keys).

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the dataset:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```
2. **Train the Model**:
   Train the sentiment analysis model with:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
3. **Analyze New Data**:
   Use the model to predict sentiment in new healthcare text data:
   ```bash
   python analyze.py --input new_data.csv --output predictions.csv
   ```

## Results
The project includes visualizations of sentiment distribution, model performance metrics, and keyword frequency analysis to provide insights into common themes and trends in healthcare sentiment.
